Area Under ROC Curve (or ROC AUC for short) is a performance metric for binary classification problems.

The AUC represents a modelâ€™s ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. An area of 1.0 represents a model that made all predictions perfectly. An area of 0.5 represents a model as good as random.

A ROC Curve is a plot of the true positive rate and the false positive rate for a given set of probability predictions at different thresholds used to map the probabilities to class labels. The area under the curve is then the approximate integral under the ROC Curve.

For more on ROC Curves and ROC AUC, see the tutorial:

How to Use ROC Curves and Precision-Recall Curves for Classification in Python
The example below provides a demonstration of calculating AUC.



# Cross Validation Classification ROC AUC
import pandas
from sklearn import model_selection
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv"
names = ['preg', 'plas', 'pres', 'skin', 'test', 'mass', 'pedi', 'age', 'class']
dataframe = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
array = dataframe.values
X = array[:,0:8]
Y = array[:,8]
seed = 7
kfold = model_selection.KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=seed)
model = LogisticRegression()
scoring = 'roc_auc'
results = model_selection.cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=kfold, scoring=scoring)
print("AUC: %.3f (%.3f)") % (results.mean(), results.std())


You can see the the AUC is relatively close to 1 and greater than 0.5, suggesting some skill in the predictions.

AUC: 0.824 (0.041)
